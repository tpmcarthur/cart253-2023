# Planets of Jupiter Simulation

This is a planetary simulations where you can travel to each planet on the canvas to learn an educational fact about the four moons of Jupiter

used some code of the previous exercise/love-actually with the different states in which each player/user visits in "if state ===" sections
referenced p5js Blend Modes for adding a glow effect the comet trail
Changed to use arrow kets for movement input instead of mouseX or mouseY, used from previous projects
In the checkIsOffScreen section I wanted it to return to the simulation state, not the title state but it would not work which is why we go back to title when off screen

Lastly, had help at the CLAB for updating and getting the trai/comet to follow input movement
